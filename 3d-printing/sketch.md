8. In the "Sketch" menu select "Sketch dimension" to give dimension to the lines. Dimension of the line is determined by the distance between its points. Select two points of the line, release the left mouse button, move your cursor aside, at a distance of 5-10 mm, so it is not intersecting any other objects or lines, and dimension is visible.
